     <h2 style="background-color: ghostwhite;">Brainstorming</h2>
   </center>
   <p>First, my team and I reviewed the rubric so we have a understanding of what was needed and then we read and annotated the texts. Our initial ideas of this project were to make different html files for each article. We then came up with the background color and CSS layor together. We each took an article to focus on (Aliyah did the NBA 2k, Arafath did CGI, and Betsy did Dna. We then added our annotated articles and answers to the following questions. We feel the most proud of the CSS layout and how we organized our html files. Something we can work on for next time is communicating better so we can save more time to add more creative things</p>

      <h2 style="background-color: ghostwhite;">Distributing the Work</h2>
    </center>
    <p>Our team decided to distribute the work evenly. We did this by having each person do different things such as Arafath doing most of planning and coding part, Aliyah doing the CSS, and Betsy doing the images and article. We also made sure each of us were focused on completing what we were given and if any of us needed help, we would give it. We tried our best to stay on task and finish it as soon as possible which was a success. </p>

     <h2 style="background-color: ghostwhite;">Proud Of</h2>
   </center>
   <p>Our team was extremely proud of how the content within our page came out and how we made each of the pages have the annotated portion of the article. We're also very happy on how we were able to describe each of the reasons the articles we got were being digitized and everything. The images for our websites also came out to look very relevant to what we wanted.</p>

      <h2 style="background-color: ghostwhite;">Most Difficult</h2>
    </center>
    <p>The most difficult part of this was using the CSS to match what we wanted. We needed to search how to make borders and design them to be able to see how to actually implement them in our website. Getting to be able to use highlights and such in the articles to show what we highlighted and underlined was also hard. </p>
