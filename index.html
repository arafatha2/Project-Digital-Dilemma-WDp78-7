    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>As a group, we each took a article to read about and we got an understanding of what point they are trying to tell us. All of these have in common the use of technology to bring out different ways to relate them to humans. From DNA, to video games, and to faking a persons existence, technology has been used in many different ways as it's said in the articles. We annotated these articles and pulled out the most important factors that have been said in these and put them in our own words. These technologies have been used for some good reasons but at the same time bad reasons. In this website you will find out wether or not using these technologies for these purposes are appropriate in these types of situations.</p>
